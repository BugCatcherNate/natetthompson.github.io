	For the past 6 months I have been heavily envolved with Unreal Engine 4, and as great as it is I needed a break from it. I decided to itch my desire to develop a 2d rpg from scratch. After much deliberation I decided to go with the pygame engine. This decision came from my recent involvement with python3 lately and I liked how the engine is open source. You can find the python module on their official <a href="http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml">website.</a>

	</div>
	<p>
	I then found myself needing a way to easily animate sprite sheets. I realized if you space each sprite of an animation on a sprite sheet evenly you could call a class instance that would iterate over this sheet. The only inputs required would be the number of columns and rows on the sprite sheets and the height and width of each sprite cell. The class I developed is shown below.
	</p>
	<div id='codes'>
	<pre>
	<code>
import pygame

class animator:

    def __init__(self, sizex, sizey, spritefile):

        #self.displaysurf = displaysurf
        self.spritefile = pygame.image.load(spritefile)
        self.count = 0
        self.sizex = sizex
        self.sizey = sizey


    def spriteget(self, rectangle):
        
        rect = pygame.Rect(rectangle)
        self.spritefile = self.spritefile.convert()
        image = pygame.Surface(rect.size).convert()
        image.blit(self.spritefile, (0, 0), rect)  
        colorkey = (255,255,255)
        image.set_colorkey(colorkey)
        return image

    def stationary(self):
        img = self.spriteget((0, 0, self.sizex, self.sizey))
        return img       

    def animation(self, spritesheetrow, numsprites):

        img = self.spriteget((self.count * self.sizex, spritesheetrow * self.sizey, self.sizex, self.sizey))
        self.count += 1
        if self.count > numsprites-1:
            self.count = 0
        return img    
	</code>
	</pre>
	</div>
	<p>
	The spriteget method initializes the sprite sheet with the correct alpha color. In this code the alpha color is set as white (255,255,255). The sprite get method is called in the animation method. The animation method iterates over the sprite sheet until the number of sprites defined by the initialization routine is reached. The current sprite number on the sprite sheet is kept in the count variable. This variable is reset to 0 after count surpases the numer of sprites on the sheet. However, this means that the sequence of sprites for an animation must be positioned in a logical manner on the sprite sheet. Also included is a stationary method that allows can be called from the main game loop. This script returns the sprite at the top right corner of the sprite sheet. This position is assumed to be the sprite that shows the character standing still. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The beauty of this class is that it can be used for any object that requires animation as long as it is being loaded from a sprite sheet. This includes everything from swaying flowers and trees to complex character attack movements. If you have anything to add to the code you can find it on my github <a href="https://github.com/natetthompson/pygameanimator">here</a>.
