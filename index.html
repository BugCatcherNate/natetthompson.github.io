	<p>
	Currently I am a graduate student in computer science at Sam Houston State University. I am employed there as a graduate assistant who is scheduled to graduate in December 2017. I have an interest in web development as well as a passion for game development. At any given time I have a handful of projects in these areas. 
	</p>
	<p>
	My interest in programming as a hobby began when I purchased a book called "C++ For Dummies". Since then my interest in computer science has taken me down many avenues as I realized the full benefit of writing my own code. Eventually I used the concepts I had learned as a hobby to help write a solvent blend prediction program in Sage using Python.

	This particular piece of software was for an undergraduate research project lead by Dr. Darren Williams as Sam Houston State University. This opportunity made me realize my passion for software design. Right now my wife Elizabeth and I live in Conroe, Texas.
